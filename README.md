# Youtube Playlist Archiver

Adds Playlist info and playlist item details to a private repository.

This projecct arose because youtube has a below POOR user interface for 
curating a  library to plan future viewing and sort current interests to
maintain for a personal library. This wastes time and can unecessarily 
take away from one's options for selecting the media or channels one may 
wish to engage.
